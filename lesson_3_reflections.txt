Github doesn't allow direct cloning onto their servers. So you first need to create a repo on their server.

Git also offers the option of a "remote repository", where you keep changes to be introduced later on.

When pushing a repo to the server, you need to specify the branch to be pushed.

You start a new repository from the website.
