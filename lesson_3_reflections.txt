Github doesn't allow direct cloning onto their servers. So you first need to create a repo on their server.

Git also offers the option of a "remote repository", where you keep changes to be introduced later on.

When pushing a repo to the server, you need to specify the branch to be pushed.

You start a new repository from the website. You need to add the remote key to the repository on your computer then. Use the code:

git remote add origin URL_provided_by_github

Check status with the command:

git remote

Or:

git remote -v

The -v stands for "verbose", and it outputs more information.
